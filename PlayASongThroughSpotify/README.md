## Description

A script used to prank friends by playing songs through Spotify. Open a PowerShell, run Spotify, do some TABs for search the song and then play it.

**Some times** popups of advertisements may come out and usually they will click on the search screen, if you want you can uncomment line 42 (and the 43 for a DELAY) so that the popup closes but in case the popup does not click then the rest of the script will not work because escaping it takes it out of its scope.

## Getting Started
